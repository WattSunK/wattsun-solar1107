Getting the right size for your solar kit is crucial for performance and value. Hereâ€™s how you can estimate your daily energy needs and pick the perfect system for your home or business.

## Step 1: List Your Appliances
- Write down each device you want to power (lights, TV, fridge, etc.)
- Note their wattage and estimated daily hours of use.

## Step 2: Calculate Daily Consumption
Multiply the wattage of each device by hours used, then add them up to get your total daily consumption (in watt-hours).

## Step 3: Choose Your Kit
Compare your total needs to our kits on the [Shop page](../../shop.html). Need help? [Contact us](../../contact.html) for free sizing advice.
